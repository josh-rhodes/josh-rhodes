# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  I'm a historian of eighteenth- and nineteenth-century Britain, focusing on agrarian and industrial development. I completed my PhD at the University of Exeter in 2019. Since then, I've taught at the University of Bristol, and held research posts at the University of Hull, the Institute of Historical Research, and the University of Cambridge.
  
  I'm currently part of the on the Living with Machines project based at the Alan Turing Institute in London, where I'm using digitised historical census data to re-assess what we know about industrialisation and how it impacted peoples' lives.
